# Simple-Lottery-Number-Generator
This basic program simply uses a pseudo-number generator to generate California lottery numbers, displaying them on the console. The user can choose which game he or she would like to play or even generate numbers for all the lottery games, displaying them all at once. Currently does not have a restart/regenerate numbers option.
